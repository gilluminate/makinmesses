										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">A while ago my dear friend Liz told me that her baby loves feeling jammies when he goes to bed.&nbsp; He can only sleep with a soft fleece pajama to love.&nbsp; She wondered if I could make a lovey blanket from a pair of his pajamas.&nbsp; I was up for the challenge, though not exactly sure what to do.&nbsp; She said that he loves the softness of the body of the pajamas, and he also loves to play with the snap that goes over the top of the zipper.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s what I came up with.&nbsp; <a rel="attachment wp-att-348" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/06/jammie-blanket/blanket/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-348" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/blanket.jpg" alt="" height="448" width="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">First of all I removed the zipper (I got a free zipper out of the deal&#8230;sweet!) I just picked it out with a seam ripper.&nbsp; I needed the extra fabric that was sewn to the zipper to close up the center of the blanket.&nbsp; Next I cut across the top just under the arm pits and the bottom just above the crotch.&nbsp; <a rel="attachment wp-att-349" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/06/jammie-blanket/blanketparts3/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-349" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/blanketparts3-249x300.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="249" /></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-350" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/06/jammie-blanket/blanketparts2/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-350" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/blanketparts2.jpg" alt="" height="384" width="265" /></a>I made two of these blankets so on the first one I cut up the sides to make them look straight and even.&nbsp; On the second one I decided that the baby doesn&#8217;t care much for straight and even so I left them the way they were.&nbsp; Slightly bigger at the bottom and smaller at the top.&nbsp; I wanted to add that snap bit from the top but I also thought it would be fun to add other things around the sides.&nbsp; I used fabric from the sleeves and legs of the pajamas to make loops and stuff.&nbsp; I used the snap bit as a pattern and made 5 more of the same shape.&nbsp; I included in that one that took in the other side of the snap.&nbsp; That way there were two snappy ends to play with and when he&#8217;s older he can even snap them together.&nbsp; I made tubes of fabric from the extra and folded them in half to make loops.&nbsp; <a rel="attachment wp-att-347" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/06/jammie-blanket/blanketparts/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-347" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/blanketparts-208x300.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="208" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">On the main blanket, I turned the fabric so that right sides were facing in and sewed together the place where the zipper was.&nbsp; I used my seam ripper and picked out places on the sides where I wanted my loops and stuff to go,&nbsp; put them into the holes I made (careful, you want the part the baby is going to play with on the inside of this blanket sandwich.&nbsp; Only the rough end should be poking out where you can see it.)&nbsp; and sewed the holes closed.&nbsp; Then leaving a wee hole to turn the whole thing right side out I sewed around the whole blanket.&nbsp; Finally I turned it all right side out and ran a top stitch over the whole thing.&nbsp; I like to make sure the little bits around the edges won&#8217;t fall off so I sew them, sew them again and then sew them again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">I&#8217;m told that Liz&#8217;s baby loves his blankets and I have to admit, I&#8217;m pretty happy with how they turned out.&nbsp; If I ever have another baby, maybe I&#8217;ll make one for him.</p>
