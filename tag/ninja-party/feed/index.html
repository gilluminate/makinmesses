<p style="text-align: center">It has been one crazy week here at my house so I haven&#8217;t had a chance to be very crafty.  I thought about crafts as I cleaned up after sick kids.  I also thought about crafts when I sat in the doctor&#8217;s office waiting for him to tell me that my baby does have R.S.V.  And I thought about crafts while I washed loads of laundry.  I did not actually do any crafts though, so no blog post this week, right?  Wrong!  I&#8217;m going to tell you about the ninja birthday party I hosted for my 7 year old&#8217;s birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">First, a disclaimer:  I have never attended a kids birthday party, not even as a kid.  Thus, I was really nervous about what to do.  The Boy wanted a ninja party so I started searching the web for and thinking of ideas.  I started with Chinese lanterns just like I remember making in elementary school.  My kids were able to help, which makes them extra fun.  Then we hung them from banisters and things.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">The guests were sent invitations to a ninja training.  We rolled up the invitations like a scroll and tied them with red ribbon.  When each child arrived at the party they were given a ninja head band so they felt more like ninjas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I assumed that there are games at a typical party so I set out to think of some for the party .  I remembered that my brother used to make paper ninja stars when we were kids so I found <a href="http://www.papercrafty.com/2005/how-to-make-an-origami-ninja-star">instructions</a> online and made each child their own color of stars.  We played a game where we improved our aim by throwing them at pictures of dragon faces on the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I found an idea online for a game where you try to keep a balloon afloat using ninja swords, so my quest for cheap ninja swords began.  I searched dollar stores and party stores but alas no swords.  I also didn&#8217;t want to spend $1 per kid for them because I was doing other stuff too.  Then my brain came up with a great idea (this doesn&#8217;t happen all that often).   <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ninjaparty2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-112" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ninjaparty2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I made these ninja swords by rolling up sheets of newspaper from corner to corner.  Then I taped it so it wouldn&#8217;t unroll.  I folded up the bottom to make the handle a bit more substantial then wrapped it in electrical tape.  Finally I wrapped the sword in tin foil.  I love the results.  The kids did too.   They weren&#8217;t awesome at the game.  They just wanted to pop balloons with their swords, but that kept them busy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Instead of cake we had <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/01/candy-sushi/">candy sushi</a>.  It turned out so cute and super tasty.  I keep trying to think of other things to do with rice krispy treats covered in fruit roll up.  <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ninjaparty6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-116" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ninjaparty6-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ninjaparty5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-115" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ninjaparty5-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>For party favors I wanted take out boxes from a restaurant.  I looked at party stores but they were so expensive.  Then my sweet husband brought home the perfect boxes that he asked for at a restaurant where he had lunch.  They gave them to him for free, but he said he left a big tip.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">We filled the boxes with fortune cookies, Chinese finger traps, and plastic ninjas that I got at the dollar store.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ninjaparty3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-113" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ninjaparty3-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>My first birthday party was a success.  The kids had fun,  my little ninja was happy, and the mom was the hero of the day!</p>
