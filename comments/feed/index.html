					<description><![CDATA[-Make a Heart Tree. cut a small branch off a tree that has a lot of little branches (dogwood trees are ideal) and hang the hearts. Or just make a wire tree yourself. Also you could paint the &quot;tree&quot; red or silver. 
-Make flowers or clovers. Glue the points together and place on a skewer. Paint skewer green. Cut and glue leaves on. Place in decorative container. For clovers use green paper.
-Make a mobile. Use tiny eye screws or wire a loop at the top of each heart and hang from rods.]]></description>
