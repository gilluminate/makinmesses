					<description><![CDATA[Hi Joooniper, 

My son and six of his friends had a brilliant Star Wars party in our living room last year.  Boy there were lighsaber battles!  His 7th birthday is coming up very soon and he has requested a Ninja Party!

Thank you so much for all the brilliant ideas! I will use it for his party!
