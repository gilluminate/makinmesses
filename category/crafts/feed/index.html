										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/03/Snowflake-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-496" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/03/Snowflake-2.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="582" srcset="/files/2012/03/Snowflake-2.jpg 715w, /files/2012/03/Snowflake-2-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></a></p>
<p>I thought this would be a fun craft to do with my kids.  My kids never got into it, but it kept me entertained.  I first saw these snowflakes in <a href="http://familyfun.go.com/crafts/snow-swabs-1030054/">Family Fun magazine</a>.  I love them because they are super cheap, they are easy to make, and the results are quite pretty.  Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done:</p>
<p>You will need:  Q-tips (I like the kind with the cardboard middle instead of plastic), a sheet of wax paper, and some glitter glue.</p>
<div style="clear: both"><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/01/Snowflake1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-486 alignnone" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/01/Snowflake1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/files/2012/01/Snowflake1-200x300.jpg 200w, /files/2012/01/Snowflake1.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></div>
<div style="clear: both">Now you just place the Q-tips into a pretty shape.  You may want to cut some of them like i&#8217;ve done with some of mine.  The <a href="http://familyfun.go.com/crafts/snow-swabs-1030054/">Family Fun magazine craft </a>has a specific pattern they do over and over.  Personally I like a little variety, especially since no two snowflakes are alike.</div>
<div style="clear: both"><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/03/snowflake-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-497" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/03/snowflake-3-300x249.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="249" srcset="/files/2012/03/snowflake-3-300x249.jpg 300w, /files/2012/03/snowflake-3.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glop on some glue.  You want to be generous with the glue.  Your snow flake is light weight but it won&#8217;t stay together without a good amount of glue.  You really need to let this dry over night.  You can watch it and check on it pulling off little branches to see if they are sticking, but that would just be silly because I&#8217;m telling you now that it needs to dry over night.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/03/snowflake-4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-498" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/03/snowflake-4-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="/files/2012/03/snowflake-4-300x200.jpg 300w, /files/2012/03/snowflake-4.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, tie a piece of fishing string to your snowflake and hang it in your window.  Then wait for the compliments to roll in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/03/Snowflake-5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-499" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2012/03/Snowflake-5-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/files/2012/03/Snowflake-5-200x300.jpg 200w, /files/2012/03/Snowflake-5.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halloween is my favorite crafting holiday.  It is pure silliness and fun.  I&#8217;ve been anticipating Halloween crafts for some time now and I&#8217;m excited to post some of my fun ideas.  Or rather, some fun takes on others ideas.  Recently I bought 1200 coffee filters.  It&#8217;s coffee filter crazy around here!  Have you ever dyed coffee filters?  I looked online and found a few ways to dye them but my favorite is to use food coloring.  Here comes the science.  I wanted to make bats wings out of coffee filters so I wanted to dye them black.  How do you get black food coloring?  I really don&#8217;t know.  I tried adding a little of every color of food coloring that I had that seemed to work, until I submerged the filters.  I like to sit the filters in the colored water bottom first and then let the water soak up the filter.  It&#8217;s just neat to watch.  Something surprising happened though, the dye began soaking up the filter in a weird way, the blue was creeping up the edges faster than the other dyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2011/10/fitlerbat10-1024x856.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-418 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2011/10/fitlerbat10-1024x856.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>I did not understand why but even when I put only a tiny bit of blue dye in, my filter turned blue on the edges.  I had to know the reason.  After a long night of google searches I finaly figured it out.  Apparently it&#8217;s called chromatography and the gist of it is that blue particles are smaller and therefore lighter weight so when traveling up a coffee filter by osmosis they move faster against gravity.  Facinating.  There is nothing better than when crafting and science come together!  (If you want to read more on Chromatography and Osmosis, you can read about it on <a href="http://pbskids.org/zoom/activities/sci/papertowelchromatogr.html">pbskids.org</a> and <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/science_explorer/black_magic.html">exploratorium.edu</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Back to the bats; So my filters turned out pink in the center and blue on the edges.  Not cool.  We tried water color paints but they just didn&#8217;t spread well and looked wrong.  finally I just dyed them agian with the food coloring, this time submurging the filters completely in the dye so that the blue didn&#8217;t travel anywhere.  They still ended up purple, but it was good enough for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">After the filters had dried I folded them in half, then in half again.  I drew a bat wingy shape and then the kids cut along the lines.  We unfolded one of the folds so that the wings were all double. (still folded in half, but not folded in quarters.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2011/10/filterbat6b.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-446 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/files/2011/10/filterbat6b.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="295" srcset="/files/2011/10/filterbat6b.jpg 1024w, /files/2011/10/filterbat6b-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></a>We applied a line of white school glue along one side of a clothes pin.  Stuck the center of the wings to the clothes pin and then added a head that I had earlier cut out of felt.  I would put patterns here, but I always just free hand stuff.  When these were dry, we decided we&#8217;d like to put them in the window so we wanted them to be double sided.  All that entailed was flipping over the clothes pin and glueing the wings and head the same way on the other side.<a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/filterbat3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-431 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/filterbat3-1024x439.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="158" /></a><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/filterbat4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-433 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/filterbat4-1024x769.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">To make them into a garland we strung a piece of yarn across the window and just used the clothes pins to clip onto the yarn.  This makes it easy to move them around if you want to.<a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/filterbat5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-417 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/filterbat5.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="306" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">Hello devoted reader.  Wow is it just me, or did summer fly by?  It&#8217;s been a mad dash to get in all of the fun we possibly could.  We vacationed, we camped, we swam, we reunioned, We&#8217;ve done it all!  Now it is time to get back to some sort of routine.  School is back in session, and so am I.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I don&#8217;t make new years resolutions but I make back to school resolutions and this year I have many.  The usual resolutions like lose weight, eat healthier, craft more, things like that.  So my drive to craft is only stronger now than it ever was.  And boy do I have ideas.  They float about my head just waiting to be made and then blogged about.  These crafts in my brain are still un-crafted though so for a little while I might have to post some things from the past.  Here, for instance, is a lovely bracelet that I learned to make a while ago.  <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/09/finger-knit-bracelet/img_7460/" rel="attachment wp-att-386"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-386 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/IMG_7460.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="518" /></a>Have you ever tried finger knitting?  Well I saw a <a title="jersy knit bracelet" href="http://www.vanessachristenson.com/2011/03/v-and-co-how-to-jersey-knit-bracelet.html" target="_blank">lovely post by V and Co.</a> on how to make a finger knit bracelet out of t-shirt yarn.  <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/03/rag-rug/">Remember how I love t-shirt yarn</a>?  Well, dear reader, I saw this and I simply had to make one</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/09/finger-knit-bracelet/img_6933/" rel="attachment wp-att-369"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/IMG_6933.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="307" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">I had never once finger knitted though.  Crazy thing is, I had a lot of trouble with it.  I can knit up a storm, but finger knitting proved challenging.  I think it was because I just couldn&#8217;t understand it using only the photos  on V and Co.&#8217;s web site.  I found <a href="http://youtu.be/t3LKAlDz9ig" target="_blank">a video that helped though</a> (this is a different technique than is shown on the V and Co website, but the results are the same.)  Once I got the hang of it, my little 7  year old wanted to learn.  He&#8217;s awesome at it, as you can see.  <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/09/finger-knit-bracelet/img_6935/" rel="attachment wp-att-368"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-368" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/IMG_6935.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="288" /></a>Well once you learn, it&#8217;s as easy as can be to make a bracelet out of T-shirt yarn.  I made one the other day in the car on my way to a wedding (I wasn&#8217;t driving).  Seriously  this takes 10 min to make.  You can make them out of anything too.  Jersy knit is stretchy so it makes it a little easier but wouldn&#8217;t it be lovely to make one out of rope?  Oh or ribbon, or wire? So many options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">A while ago my dear friend Liz told me that her baby loves feeling jammies when he goes to bed.&nbsp; He can only sleep with a soft fleece pajama to love.&nbsp; She wondered if I could make a lovey blanket from a pair of his pajamas.&nbsp; I was up for the challenge, though not exactly sure what to do.&nbsp; She said that he loves the softness of the body of the pajamas, and he also loves to play with the snap that goes over the top of the zipper.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s what I came up with.&nbsp; <a rel="attachment wp-att-348" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/06/jammie-blanket/blanket/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-348" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/blanket.jpg" alt="" height="448" width="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">First of all I removed the zipper (I got a free zipper out of the deal&#8230;sweet!) I just picked it out with a seam ripper.&nbsp; I needed the extra fabric that was sewn to the zipper to close up the center of the blanket.&nbsp; Next I cut across the top just under the arm pits and the bottom just above the crotch.&nbsp; <a rel="attachment wp-att-349" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/06/jammie-blanket/blanketparts3/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-349" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/blanketparts3-249x300.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="249" /></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-350" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/06/jammie-blanket/blanketparts2/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-350" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/blanketparts2.jpg" alt="" height="384" width="265" /></a>I made two of these blankets so on the first one I cut up the sides to make them look straight and even.&nbsp; On the second one I decided that the baby doesn&#8217;t care much for straight and even so I left them the way they were.&nbsp; Slightly bigger at the bottom and smaller at the top.&nbsp; I wanted to add that snap bit from the top but I also thought it would be fun to add other things around the sides.&nbsp; I used fabric from the sleeves and legs of the pajamas to make loops and stuff.&nbsp; I used the snap bit as a pattern and made 5 more of the same shape.&nbsp; I included in that one that took in the other side of the snap.&nbsp; That way there were two snappy ends to play with and when he&#8217;s older he can even snap them together.&nbsp; I made tubes of fabric from the extra and folded them in half to make loops.&nbsp; <a rel="attachment wp-att-347" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/06/jammie-blanket/blanketparts/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-347" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/blanketparts-208x300.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="208" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">On the main blanket, I turned the fabric so that right sides were facing in and sewed together the place where the zipper was.&nbsp; I used my seam ripper and picked out places on the sides where I wanted my loops and stuff to go,&nbsp; put them into the holes I made (careful, you want the part the baby is going to play with on the inside of this blanket sandwich.&nbsp; Only the rough end should be poking out where you can see it.)&nbsp; and sewed the holes closed.&nbsp; Then leaving a wee hole to turn the whole thing right side out I sewed around the whole blanket.&nbsp; Finally I turned it all right side out and ran a top stitch over the whole thing.&nbsp; I like to make sure the little bits around the edges won&#8217;t fall off so I sew them, sew them again and then sew them again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">I&#8217;m told that Liz&#8217;s baby loves his blankets and I have to admit, I&#8217;m pretty happy with how they turned out.&nbsp; If I ever have another baby, maybe I&#8217;ll make one for him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>I love you for looking at my blog.  I love that you keep me feeling crafty because I&#8217;d hate to disappoint you.  I thank you for again stopping by to see my messes.   The bad news is that my family just got a new computer.  It&#8217;s lovely and fast but I have no idea how to use it.  I&#8217;m figuring it out, but its a real shift in thinking.   The real problem is that I don&#8217;t know how to save photos for the web, so I can&#8217;t post photos of my crafty endeavors.  I have every intention of learning all this new stuff and posting again really soon.  Maybe I&#8217;ll even get you a new post next week.  Until then check out another of my favorite craft web sites:  <a href="http://www.oneprettything.com/">http://www.oneprettything.com/</a> Beautiful and so full of inspiration.  I hope you like it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to my blog.  I&#8217;m sorry It&#8217;s been so long.  Crafting took a wee vacation from my house.  That&#8217;s not entirely true but many of my attempts at fun crafts turned out&#8230;.well&#8230;.unblog-worthy.  After sewing through my finger I decided that maybe I needed to take a break.  I&#8217;m back though and soon my sister will be contributing to the blog too.  She&#8217;s awesome so you can get excited.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s blog post is something I  came up with about 30 min before church.  I wanted a cute bracelet to wear with a new outfit but I didn&#8217;t have anything that matched.  I pulled out some stuff I had and crocheted myself a bracelet.  I only had time to make one then, but I have made more since (and I plan to make even more.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a rel="attachment wp-att-304" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/05/crochet-bracelet/bracelet/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-304 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/bracelet-853x1024.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="368" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll need to make your own pretty crochet bracelets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Jelly Bracelets</p>
<p style="text-align: center">embroidery thread</p>
<p style="text-align: center">A crochet hook</p>
<p style="text-align: center">White Glue (if you want to starch them)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I got my bracelets and thread at Honks Dollar store on .88 cent Tuesday.  This means that each bracelet only costs about .22 cents to make.   A cheapskate such as myself get&#8217;s pretty excited about that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a rel="attachment wp-att-305" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/05/crochet-bracelet/bracelet1/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-305 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/bracelet1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">All you need to do now is tie a knot with the thread around the bracelet and then single crochet all the way around.  I didn&#8217;t really count my stitches.  I just crochet until the bracelet is completely covered and I can&#8217;t see bits of bracelet peeking through.  When you get all the way around join the end with a slip stitch into the beginning single crochet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Next I c<a rel="attachment wp-att-308" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/05/crochet-bracelet/bracelet4/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-308 alignright" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/bracelet4-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="189" /></a>rochet a different border around each bracelet.  Some picots, some ruffles, some scallops.  I&#8217;m still thinking of other borders I can crochet.  Most of these only take one little skein of thread, but if you do a stitch that takes more, you might need to use a little of a second skein.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">That&#8217;s it, just weave in your end and your done. Well, mostly.  After a while I found that my borders were curling.  It bothered me.  I decided to starch my bracelets to make them stand out better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To starch them I mixed 1 cup of water with 1 tsp of white school  glue.  I dunked the bracelets then set them out on wax paper, pulling  out the little picots and scallops.  I don&#8217;t know how long they will  stay starchy but I do like the results so I will be doing this with all  of my bracelets from now on.  Do you want to make some bracelets?  You should  because it&#8217;s cheap, easy, and the results are pretty fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">A while ago I got to thinking about how to display dyed Easter eggs.  Usually we put them back in their carton in the fridge.  Refrigeration is a good idea, but I still wanted something cute.  I came up with the idea to make flowers out of toilet paper rolls.  I like using household items to make something pretty.  <a rel="attachment wp-att-280" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/04/egg-garden/egggarden/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-280" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/egggarden.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>One egg holder is no help at all, so I needed a garden.  A garden needs a little fence.  I had a box from a bakery (those brown doughnut boxes) and it looked to be just the right size.  I cut down the sides and covered them with some green tape.  Then I used hot glue and little tiny Popsicle sticks to make a picket fence.  I used scissors to cut points on the Popsicle sticks because that&#8217;s fency.  <a rel="attachment wp-att-281" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/04/egg-garden/egggarden2/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-281" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/egggarden2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-282" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/04/egg-garden/egggarden1/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-282" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/egggarden1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>I filled the box with green Easter grass.  I hate Easter grass so I glued it down with lots of hot glue so it won&#8217;t come loose and I won&#8217;t go crazy picking it up all over the house.</p>
<p>As for the flowers, I drew a flower freehand.  Then I sat at the computer for an hour perfecting a completely not-freehand flower because I can&#8217;t stand petals that are different sizes.  I made 3 different sizes of flowers just for variety.  I cut slits in the middle so I could glue the flower to the cardboard tube  I put a little strip of a different color around the inside.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-283" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/04/egg-garden/egggarden3/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-283" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/egggarden3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Finally I wrapped green yarn around and around the tube/stem of each flower.   I hot glued the flowers into the flower garden box with short flowers in front and taller ones in the back.  Voila, flower garden to hold eggs:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-284" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/04/egg-garden/egggarden4/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-284 alignnone" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/egggarden4-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-285" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/04/egg-garden/egggarden5/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-285 alignnone" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/egggarden5-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to make something completely disposable because I don&#8217;t have anywhere to keep all the stuff I make.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s made mostly out of paper and cardboard.  This little garden was a lot of work though, so I don&#8217;t see myself throwing it away any time soon.</p>
<p>P.s. One day, after I had been working on this project for a while, I saw that <a href="http://familyfun.go.com/easter/easter-crafts/all-easter-crafts/egg-garden-672364/">FamilyFun&#8217;s website</a> made flower Easter egg holders from toilet paper rolls too.  I thought I had a pretty original idea here, but I was wrong.  All well, I still like mine.</p>

<p>This weekend found me and my boys coloring rice.  Don&#8217;t ask me why, it would take too long to explain.  I will tell you this though, it was lots of fun.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-228" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/04/colored-rice-picture/rice/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-228" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/Rice.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="280" /></a>I found my instructions on <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/color-rice">squidoo</a>. It&#8217;s surprisingly easy, essentially you put a couple of cups of rice in a plastic zippy bag.  Then you add a few drops of food coloring and a couple of Tbs of water, zip it up and squish to your hearts content.  Last you just spread the rice out to dry.  A different blog suggested drying out the rice in the oven at 200 degrees for about 15 min.  I did use the oven to dry our rice mostly then laid it out to dry the rest of the way.  I didn&#8217;t take photos of the process, but here&#8217;s the rice all laid out to dry.</p>
<p>Pretty, right?  I love the vivid colors.</p>
<p>So what do you do with colored rice?  Well we made rice pictures (like sand pictures but with rice).</p>
<p>To make our pictures I printed an egg shape (I can&#8217;t draw so don&#8217;t ask me to).  The kids drew lines to show where to put the colors decorate the egg.  They used white school glue to fill in the places they wanted color then shook some rice onto the glue.  We let one color dry before moving on to the next color.  That way the colors stayed where they belonged.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-234" href="https://www.makinmesses.com/2011/04/colored-rice-picture/ricedraw/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-234" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/ricedraw.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="320" /></a>This was loads of fun and we love the results too.  The only problem is that the rice keeps falling off,  and the paper warped.  How could I fix these problems?   Could I spray them with something to make the rice stay put?  could I have pressed them with something while drying to make them stay flat?  I just don&#8217;t know.  Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Stay tuned for another colored rice project.  It&#8217;ll be fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well my dear blog reader, already I have failed you.  I promised a new post every week and last week I did not post.  I have no awesome excuse.   I have been riddled with guilt but alas, I just didn&#8217;t have anything new to post.  Was I not crafting?  Well not much.  Today I am back however and I apologize for my absence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A couple of weeks ago my husband cleaned out his T-Shirt drawer.  When he does this it&#8217;s like Christmas for me.  I love love love to cut up t-shirts to make yarn.  Something about the thriftiness of it all thrills me.  What I end up with is a whole lot of t-shirt yarn and no project.  I decided to start with the least pleasing colors and make a rug.  Just to get a feel of the yarn and what it will look like when I work it up.  <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/tshirtf.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/tshirtf.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s ugly, I know.  But it gets me going with other ideas.  Want to make your own rag yarn?  I was going to make a tutorial but it takes 2 hands to make this stuff and I&#8217;m not smart enough to figure out how to take photos at the same time.  Why would I repeat what others have done so well anyway?  So if you want to make your own t-shirt rag yarn (some people call it tarn&#8230;those people are crazy)  look at this <a href="http://www.craftpassion.com/2009/05/recycle-tutorial-making-of-t-shirt-yarn.html">tutorial by Craft Passion</a>.  See how she made a basket at the end?  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do next with my pretty colors of tarn.</p>
<p>Here are a few more photos to inspire you.</p>

<p>I started with some green cotton yarn (my favorite is Peaches &#8216;n Cream brand but Walmart stopped carrying it.  Jerks replaced it with a brand with a similar name but not similar quality. )</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/StPatsWall4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-149" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/StPatsWall4-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I buy my cotton on cones but I&#8217;m sure that you could make this with a  couple of balls of one color and one ball of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">You will need :</p>
<p style="text-align: left">2 Colors of green cotton yarn</p>
<p style="text-align: left">H and a G crochet hooks</p>
<p style="text-align: left">1/3 a yard of 2 different green printed  fabrics</p>
<p style="text-align: left">a sheet of foam board</p>
<p style="text-align: left">a glue gun.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">cut your fabric into 12 inch squares.  Two of one color and one of the other color.  Then cut your foam board into 10 inch squares.  I use foam board because it&#8217;s cheap (i get mine at the dollar store), and because it&#8217;s light weight.  I can hang my finished product with blue putty sticky stuff and no walls are damaged.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/StPatsWall.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-146" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/StPatsWall-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="184" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted these to look like canvases so I glued together 2 squares of    foam board to get a thicker look. Next, using a glue gun I stretched the    fabric over the foam board and glued it around the edges on the back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">All you need now are some shamrocks.  My large shamrocks were made from a pattern for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010816080523/members.aol.com/cillcrochets/shamrockph.html">shamrock potholders</a> designed by Priscilla Hewitt.  I made 2 but I only made the front side of them (the pattern tells you to make it double sided).  Next I made a whole bunch of little shamrocks using a pattern from <a href="http://suzies-yarnie-stuff.blogspot.com/2006/03/my-shamrock-pin-pattern.html">Suzies Stuff</a>.  They are super fun to make.  I glued one big shamrock in the center of two of the squares then glued the little shamrocks on the contrasting square.  That&#8217;s all. <a href="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/StPatsWall2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-147 aligncenter" src="https://www.makinmesses.com/contents/uploads/www.makinmesses.com/StPatsWall2-682x1024.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="491" /></a>UPDATE:  Sorry about my spelling in this post.  I really need to proofread better.  Also, I love my camera, she&#8217;s my dear friend, but sometimes we don&#8217;t get along at all.  She&#8217;s being mean to me lately and we&#8217;re working it out together but in the mean time my photos look bad.  We both apologize.</p>
